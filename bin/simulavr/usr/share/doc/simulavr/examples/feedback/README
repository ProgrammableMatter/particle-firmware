This example illustrates how one can provide a program external to the
simulated AVR which provides "feedback" to the simulated program.  A
feedback program can interact with the AVR hosted program just like devices
would in the "real world." 

This example is certainly a primitive example of this but it illustrates
the principle.  The application writes the following lines to UART0:

hello world #1
hello world #2
hello world #3
hello world #1

The initial input value of ADC0 is 0.  When the feedback modules seens
1, 2 or 3, it changes the "voltage" on ADC0.  The debug output expected is:

ADC0=10 expect 10
ADC0=20 expect 20
ADC0=30 expect 30
ADC0=10 expect 10
